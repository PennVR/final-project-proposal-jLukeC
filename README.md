Artist's Catalouge in VR
==========================
I think VR can be a really cool way to explore an artist's catalogue of work. We could build a platform for viewing artists' pieces (drawings, paintings, etc) along with their inspirations and descriptions of their projects. The goal would be to build something immersive and give viewers a solid understanding of the artist's creative process.

Leigh McCloskey is a good example of an artist with some crazy works that would look good in VR:

Music Visualizer
================
The goal with this project would be to build a visual piece that people can just lose themselves in. Procedurally generate landscapes and visuals based on songs. Try to incorporate album art or music videos into the experience.

Or like a 3d version of this project: [(Unseen Music) YUME](http://unseen-music.com/yume/)


House Navigation
===============
Lets say you take a photosphere of every room in a house. This project would involve building a content management system that would allow you to quickly connect these photospheres into one unified viewing experience. People could traverse the house by clicking down hallways into rooms and each room could have an info section activated by looking at some sort of tooltip. Similar to indoor GoogleMaps but user has full control and can add transitions, and information on visual hover
